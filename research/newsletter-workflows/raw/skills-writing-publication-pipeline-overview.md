# Claude Writing Skills

A set of [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skills for running a writing publication. The system I use to write [The Long Game](https://substack.com/@nadiem99) — a Substack about how individuals and nations position for long-term success amid structural change.

These skills turn writing from a guessing game into a workflow. Each skill is a stage in the editorial pipeline: extracting your thinking through an interview, structuring it into an outline, drafting it section by section, coaching the argument, line editing the prose, source-checking the claims, screening for AI tells, and repurposing for social.

Built on top of an Obsidian vault with Readwise integration for reading highlights — but the skills work with any markdown-based setup.

Packaged as a [Claude Code plugin](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins). Install the whole pipeline or lift a single skill.

## Install

Uses the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI, which reads this repo's plugin manifest and copies the skills you pick into your project's `.claude/skills/`.

```bash
# the whole pipeline (pick interactively)
npx skills add nadiem99/claude-writing-skills

# just one skill
npx skills add nadiem99/claude-writing-skills --skill interview

# install globally for every project (~/.claude/skills)
npx skills add nadiem99/claude-writing-skills -g
```

Then run Claude Code from your writing vault and the commands (`/interview`, `/outline`, …) are available.

<details>
<summary>Manual install (no CLI)</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nadiem99/claude-writing-skills.git
cd claude-writing-skills

# copy the skills you want into your vault's .claude/skills/
mkdir -p /path/to/your/vault/.claude/skills
cp -r skills/pipeline/* /path/to/your/vault/.claude/skills/
cp -r skills/support/*  /path/to/your/vault/.claude/skills/

# copy the context + templates the skills read from
cp -r context templates CLAUDE.md /path/to/your/vault/
```

</details>

**Run [`setup`](./skills/support/setup) first.** It writes `context/brand-guide.md` based on a short interview about your publication, audience, pillars, and voice. Every other skill reads from that file. Skip this and the output sounds generic — the skills have nothing specific to calibrate against.

## What's in here

Eleven skills, all user-invoked slash commands. Grouped into the editorial **pipeline** and the **support** skills that feed it.

### Pipeline — the 8-stage editorial flow

- **[`interview`](./skills/pipeline/interview/SKILL.md)** — One-question-at-a-time Socratic interview to draw out what you actually think about a topic. Produces the raw material that becomes an essay.
- **[`outline`](./skills/pipeline/outline/SKILL.md)** — Turns an idea or interview into a structured outline. Follows the narrative-first arc: concrete → mechanism → implications.
- **[`draft`](./skills/pipeline/draft/SKILL.md)** — Section-by-section drafting partner. Reads your voice notes before writing and explicitly states which patterns it's calibrating against. Never generates a full article in one shot.
- **[`coach`](./skills/pipeline/coach/SKILL.md)** — Developmental edit. Triages thesis, structure, and argument before scoring style. Modeled on Eleanor Warnock's editorial approach: structure first, prose second.
- **[`edit`](./skills/pipeline/edit/SKILL.md)** — Line edit. Tightens prose, strengthens verbs, fixes rhythm. Runs a mechanical style sweep first, then goes paragraph by paragraph.
- **[`source-check`](./skills/pipeline/source-check/SKILL.md)** — Verifies every factual claim. Maintains a Sources section at the bottom of the draft. Flags vague attribution and overstatements.
- **[`top-edit`](./skills/pipeline/top-edit/SKILL.md)** — Final mechanical pass. Screens for 17 categories of AI tells, checks house style, recommends a paragraph for the voice notes, and runs a session retro to surface lessons that improve the system over time.
- **[`repurpose`](./skills/pipeline/repurpose/SKILL.md)** — Converts a published essay into X threads and LinkedIn posts. Extracts building blocks first, then generates options.

### Support — feed the pipeline

- **[`setup`](./skills/support/setup/SKILL.md)** — **Run this first.** Interactive onboarding. Captures publication identity, audience, pillars, and voice. Writes `context/brand-guide.md`.
- **[`research`](./skills/support/research/SKILL.md)** — Surfaces relevant reading highlights from your vault, finds connections across notes, and suggests external sources.
- **[`status`](./skills/support/status/SKILL.md)** — Shows pipeline state across ideas, outlines, drafts, review, and published. Recommends what to work on next.

## How they chain

```
setup           → (writes context/brand-guide.md, read by every skill below)

interview       → outline → draft → coach → edit → source-check → top-edit → repurpose
                                       ↑                                    ↓
                                       └──── (going backwards is normal) ───┘
research        → fuels interview, outline, draft, source-check
status          → run any time to see pipeline state
```

The pipeline is a guide, not a conveyor belt. Drafting is sculpting, not construction. Going from draft back to outline, or from coaching back to draft, is normal and expected.

### First steps after install

1. Run `/setup` and answer the questions. This fills in `context/brand-guide.md`.
2. Open `context/writing-principles.md` and `context/ai-tells-checklist.md`. Read them, edit anything you disagree with — these are your defaults, not gospel.
3. When you have your first article idea, run `/interview [topic]` to extract your thinking, then `/outline` to structure it.

## Working with Obsidian + Readwise

This is the setup I use. Not required, but recommended.

### Why Obsidian

- **Plain markdown.** Every file is a `.md` file with YAML frontmatter. Claude Code can read and edit them natively. No proprietary format, no lock-in.
- **Linking.** `[[Wikilinks]]` between notes turn your vault into a graph. Articles can reference reading highlights, ideas can reference earlier ideas. The skills follow these links when they need context.
- **Folder structure becomes pipeline state.** Moving a file from `Writing/Drafts/` to `Writing/Review/` is the entire act of "advancing" it. The `/status` skill reads these folders directly.

### Why Readwise

[Readwise](https://readwise.io) syncs highlights from Kindle, Twitter/X, articles you read on the web, podcasts, and more — into a central library. The Readwise → Obsidian plugin auto-imports those highlights as markdown files in your vault.

This matters because the `/research` and `/source-check` skills read from your highlights folder. Every book you've read, every article you've highlighted, every tweet you've saved becomes searchable raw material. When you write a piece on a topic, the skills surface what you've already thought about it — including your own annotations.

### Recommended vault structure

After install, the skills live in your vault's `.claude/skills/`. The rest is content:

```
YourVault/
├── .claude/skills/         ← installed by the skills CLI
├── .obsidian/              ← Obsidian's own config
├── context/                ← from this repo (filled in by /setup)
├── templates/              ← from this repo
├── CLAUDE.md               ← from this repo
├── Inbox/                  ← quick captures
├── Reading notes/          ← Readwise sync target
│   ├── Books/
│   ├── Articles/
│   └── X Posts/
└── Writing/
    ├── Ideas/
    ├── Interviews/         ← /interview output
    ├── Outline/
    ├── Drafts/
    ├── Review/
    ├── Published/
    ├── Threads/
    └── LinkedIn/
```

Add `.claude/` to your Obsidian "Files & Links → Excluded files" list so Obsidian doesn't index the skill files in your graph view.

## Philosophy

A few opinionated choices baked into these skills:

**Voice calibration is mandatory, not optional.** The `/draft` skill reads `context/voice-notes.md` before writing any prose and explicitly states which patterns it's calibrating against. If it doesn't, it's not following the skill.

**The writer drives. Always.** No skill generates a full article in one shot. Drafting is collaborative, section by section, with multiple options for the writer to choose from.

**The system improves itself.** After each `/top-edit`, the skill recommends a paragraph to add to your voice notes (so future drafts calibrate against your actual best work) and runs a retro on chat friction (so writing principles, AI tells, and skill instructions get sharper over time).

**AI tells are a checklist, not a vibe.** The `/top-edit` skill screens for 17 specific patterns mechanically. Any drafting skill that tries to write before consulting that checklist is shipping AI slop.

**Structural feedback before prose feedback.** `/coach` triages thesis, structure, and argument before scoring style. A beautifully written essay with a broken argument is still broken.

## Customization

You will want to edit:

- `context/brand-guide.md` — the most important file. `/setup` writes a draft. Refine it.
- `context/writing-principles.md` — these are my principles. Yours might be different.
- `context/ai-tells-checklist.md` — add patterns you catch in your own drafts.
- Each skill's `SKILL.md` — adjust voice rules, format preferences, output formats. The skills are markdown — edit them like any other note.

The whole system is just markdown plus a few conventions Claude Code follows. Nothing is sacred. Make it yours.

## Credits

- [Matt Pocock's skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) — the plugin layout and single-skill install model this repo now follows.
- Zevenue's [`gtm-skills`](https://github.com/Zevenue/gtm-skills) repo — an early structural model for sharing Claude Code skill systems.

Installed with the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI by Vercel Labs.

If you use these skills and improve them, send me your changes — I'd love to see what you do.

# Claude Writing Skills — System Overview

This file is read automatically by Claude Code at the start of every session in this directory. It explains the system to the model so the skills behave consistently.

## What This Is

A set of Claude Code skills for running a writing publication — extracting ideas, outlining, drafting, editing, source-checking, and repurposing for social. Designed to work with Obsidian + Readwise but compatible with any markdown-based writing setup.

## The Editorial Pipeline

Every piece moves through this 8-stage pipeline. Not every piece needs every stage — but this is the full sequence from raw idea to distribution.

```
1. Interview     →  Extract thinking, produce raw material       /interview
2. Outline       →  Structure the argument                       /outline
3. Draft         →  Sculpt the material section by section       /draft
4. Coach         →  Developmental edit (thesis, structure, arg)  /coach
5. Edit          →  Line edit (prose polish)                     /edit
6. Source Check  →  Verify claims, maintain source list          /source-check
7. Top Edit      →  AI tells & pattern check (mechanical pass)   /top-edit
8. Repurpose     →  Social distribution (X threads, LinkedIn)    /repurpose
```

**Key principle:** Drafting is sculpting, not construction. Going backwards (from draft back to outline, or from coaching back to draft) is normal and expected. The pipeline is a guide, not a conveyor belt.

## Onboarding

**Run `/setup` first.** It writes `context/brand-guide.md` based on a short interview about the writer's publication, audience, pillars, and voice. Every other skill reads from that file.

## Core Files (the "context layer")

The skills read from these. Edit them directly, or let `/setup` and `/top-edit` populate them over time.

- `context/brand-guide.md` — Publication identity, pillars, voice. Filled in by `/setup`.
- `context/writing-principles.md` — The rules every piece is checked against. Edit freely.
- `context/ai-tells-checklist.md` — Patterns that make writing sound AI-generated. Grows over time.
- `context/voice-notes.md` — Curated examples of the writer's best paragraphs. Grows after each `/top-edit`.

## Recommended Vault Structure

The skills assume a folder structure for content. Use this as-is or adapt:

```
Inbox/                              → Quick captures, fleeting ideas
Reading notes/                      → Imported highlights (Readwise, Kindle, articles)
Writing/
  ├── Ideas/                        → Seed ideas
  ├── Interviews/                   → /interview output (raw material)
  ├── Outline/                      → Structured outlines
  ├── Drafts/                       → Active drafts
  ├── Review/                       → Drafts under final review
  ├── Published/                    → Final published versions
  ├── Threads/                      → X thread drafts
  ├── LinkedIn/                     → LinkedIn post drafts
  └── Content Calendar/             → Publishing schedule (optional)
context/                            → Foundation files (read by every skill)
templates/                          → Frontmatter templates for new notes
```

## Voice & Style Rules

These layer on top of the writing principles. They are enforced by `/draft` and screened by `/top-edit`.

**DO:**
- Open with a concrete experience or scene (narrative-first)
- Follow the arc: concrete → mechanism → implications
- Support claims with evidence, data, or historical parallels
- Use the writer's natural voice — direct, specific, occasionally funny
- Use lived experience details (what makes the writing irreplaceable)
- Teach the reader something they didn't know before

**DON'T:**
- Sound like AI (signpost-heavy, emotionally flat, overly structured)
- Use consultant-speak ("Let's unpack this", "At the end of the day")
- Use signpost phrases ("In this article", "Let's explore", "Without further ado")
- Make claims without evidence
- Write things anyone could have written
- Generate full articles in one shot — always work section by section

## Key Rule

**The writer drives the writing.** The skills suggest, coach, and edit — but every decision about what to say and how to say it is the writer's. Never generate a full article in one shot. Always work collaboratively, section by section, with multiple options for the writer to choose from.
