- What it is: THE measured source for syntactic/grammatical AI tells. Two parallel corpora (n=12,000 human texts across academic, news, fiction, spoken word, blogs, TV/movie scripts; plus COCA) where an LLM was given the first ~500 words of a real human text and asked to continue in the same style, tone and diction. Both halves then tagged with Douglas Biber's 66-feature tagset and compared with paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (Bonferroni corrected). This is MEASURED, peer-reviewed, and it is about SHAPES not words.

## Headline measured numbers (structural lane)

- GPT-4o uses **present participial clauses at 5.3x the human rate** (paired Cohen's d = 1.38). Instruction-tuned LLMs generally: **2 to 5 times** the human rate.
- GPT-4o uses **"that" clauses as sentence subject 2.6x** as often (d = 0.77).
- GPT-4o uses **nominalizations 2.1x** as often (d = 1.23). Instruction-tuned models generally 1.5-2x.
- GPT-4o uses **phrasal coordination 1.9x** as often (d = 0.81).
- GPT-4o uses the **agentless passive voice at roughly HALF the human rate** (i.e. the "AI uses passive voice" folklore is backwards for this model).
- Both GPT-4o models **avoid clausal coordination**; all Llama 3 variants use it MORE than humans.
- A random forest on Biber features alone separated human vs one specific LLM at **93-98% accuracy**; 7-way source classification hit 66% vs 14% chance, with only 4.2% of LLM texts misclassified as human.
- **Instruction tuning makes models LESS human, not more.** Llama 3 base models use these features at rates close to humans; the instruct variants diverge sharply.
- Word-level bonus (not my lane but measured): "tapestry" appeared in **23% of GPT-4o outputs** and "amidst" in **27%**. camaraderie at 162x human rate, tapestry 155x, intricate 119x, underscore 107x, unspoken 102x, amidst 100x, palpable 95x, solace 95x, fleeting 84x, unravel 83x.

Large language models (LLMs) are capable of writing grammatical text that follows instruc-
tions, answers questions, and solves problems. As they have advanced, it has become
difficult to distinguish their output from human-written text. While past research has found
some differences in features such as word choice and punctuation, and developed classifiers
to detect LLM output, none has studied the rhetorical styles of LLMs. Using several variants
of Llama 3 and GPT-4o, we construct two parallel corpora of human- and LLM-written texts
from common prompts. Using Douglas Biber’s set of lexical, grammatical, and rhetorical
features, we identify systematic differences between LLMs and humans and between different
LLMs. These differences persist when moving from smaller models to larger ones, and
are larger for instruction-tuned models than base models. This observation of differences
demonstrates that despite their advanced abilities, LLMs struggle to match human stylistic
variation. Attention to more advanced linguistic features can hence detect patterns in their
behavior not previously recognized.

A
s large language models (LLMs) have advanced in recent years, from “stochastic
parrots” to models evidently capable of performing complex tasks, most
attention has focused on their reasoning performance: solving mathematical
problems, writing code, evaluating arguments, diagnosing diseases, and so on ( 1–4).
While past research has studied their mastery of basic grammar and vocabulary
(5), there is relatively little research on their language performance more generally:
their ability to produce readable text in a variety of styles. Rather than exploring
it in detail, commentators discuss the business and communication tasks that
might be automated by LLMs with their writing ability, or consider the dangers of
impersonation and misinformation facilitated by LLMs ( 6–9). As more and more
writing tasks are automated, such problems appear inevitable.
However, the impression that LLMs write “like humans” is based primarily on
qualitative evaluation of their output, not on thorough linguistic evaluation of their
text. So far, quantitative comparisons have looked mainly at basic grammar and
syntax (5) or features such as word choice, punctuation, sentence length, and so on,
finding evidence of some differences between human- and LLM-written text ( 10–14).
Other work has used these features, or language models trained on sample texts,
to classify LLM-written texts with varying degrees of success ( 15–17). Though
not definitive, these results suggest there are indeed structural differences between
human- and LLM-written text.
We used several recent LLMs (OpenAI’s GPT-4o and GPT-4o Mini, and four
variants of Meta Llama 3) to generate text from prompts drawn from a large,
representative corpus of English, allowing us to directly compare the style of LLM
writing to human writing. We find large differences in grammatical, lexical, and
stylistic features, demonstrating that LLMs prefer specific grammatical structures
and struggle to match the stylistic variation present in human communication,
particularly as that variation aligns with the conventions that structure genres
such as academic writing, interactive speech, or journalistic news. In Llama 3,
where we are able to compare base models (which produce text completions) to
instruction-tuned variants (which have been further trained to answer questions
and complete tasks specified in prompts), we further see that the instruction tuning
introduces more extreme grammatical differences, making them easier to distinguish
from human writing and introducing features similar to those present in GPT-4o
and GPT-4o Mini.
For example, the instruction-tuned LLMs used present participial clauses at 2
to 5 times the rate of human text, such as in this sentence from GPT-4o using
Significance Statement
As large language models (LLMs)
have grown in power and become
more widely available, research has
focused on their ability to com-
plete various tasks and the biases
they exhibit when doing so. In
this study, we instead examine
their writing style in detail. We
show that instruction-tuned mod-
els, which are trained to answer
questions and solve problems, have
a distinct noun-heavy, information-
ally dense writing style, even when
prompted to match the style of infor-
mal speech and writing. These find-
ings suggest that instruction-tuned
models generate text that does
not align with genre conventions
familiar to human audiences, and
demonstrate the value of linguistic
variables in evaluating the output of
LLMs.

two present participles: “Bryan, leaning on his agility , dances
around the ring, evading Show’s heavy blows . ” They also use
nominalizations at 1.5 to 2 times the rate of humans, such
as in this sentence from Llama 3 70B Instruct containing
four: “These schemes can help to reduce deforestation, habitat
destruction, and pollution, while also promoting sustainable
consumption patterns. ” On the other hand, GPT-4o uses the
agentless passive voice at roughly half the rate as human
texts—but in each case, the Llama base models use these
features at rates more closely matching humans. This suggests
that instruction tuning, rather than training the models
to write even more like humans, instead trains them in a
particular informationally dense, noun-heavy style, and limits
their ability to mimic other writing styles leading to, in some
cases, genre misalignment.
These results demonstrate the value of attending to linguis-
tic structure (morphosyntactic, functional, and rhetorical) in
order to better understand the affordances and outputs of
large language models. Since the rise of the Internet and the
concurrent development of efficient processing architectures,
language modeling has relied on relatively simple linguistic
principles (i.e., sequences and context windows) as the
availability of massive amounts of text allowed models trained
on text to rapidly outperform older paradigms based on
linguistic theory (18); but linguistic theory can provide better
ways to evaluate LLM output, just as improved benchmark
problems can provide better ways to evaluate their reasoning
ability. These results also demonstrate the limits of current
LLMs in matching human language, showing that despite
their apparent ability, they have measurable limitations
compared to human authors.
Methods
We created two corpora of parallel human- and LLM-written
texts. Each corpus began with n = 12, 000 human-authored
English texts from a range of genres, from spoken word (such
as podcast transcripts) to news and magazine articles to
formal academic writing. Language use varies in relation to
situational factors such as audience and purpose ( 19, 20);
by including multiple genres, we aimed to capture a diverse
range of language production. As illustrated in Figure 1, from
each text we extracted two consecutive chunks of roughly 500
words (split at sentence boundaries). The first chunk was
provided to each LLM to give it context and a sample of the
writing style. The LLMs were prompted to write 500 more
words in the same style, tone, and diction; their generated
text was then compared to the next 500-word chunk of the
human text. We used six LLMs: GPT-4o and GPT-4o Mini
(21, 22) and Meta Llama 3 8B, 70B, 8B Instruct, and 70B
Instruct ( 23), producing six LLM-authored texts for each
human-authored text. See the SI Appendix for detailed
prompt information.
We constructed the first corpus, the Human-AI Parallel
English corpus, from six categories of text (academic, news,
fiction, spoken word, blogs, and TV/movie scripts). The
second corpus, the COCA AI Parallel (CAP) Corpus, is drawn
from the pre-existing Corpus of Contemporary American
English (COCA), a large, representative corpus of over 1
billion words in eight registers: spoken, fiction, magazines,
newspapers, academic, blogs, web pages, and TV/movie
subtitles (24). The HAP-E corpus was used for our primary
analyses, while CAP was used to evaluate the generalizability
of the results to different texts. The LLMs sometimes refused
to respond to prompts or gave short, unusable answers; after
these were removed, there were n = 8, 290 HAP-E texts and
n = 9, 615 CAP texts with outputs from all LLMs. With two
human chunks and six LLM-authored chunks for each text,
HAP-E comprised n = 66, 320 chunks and CAP n = 76, 920
chunks. See SI Appendix Tables S2–S3 for corpus size and
composition.
To extract meaningful features from our corpus for training
our classifiers, we used Douglas Biber’s tagset of 66 linguistic
categories ( 19, 25, 26), which includes indices of lexical
complexity and raw linguistic features ranging from the
lexical to the grammatical. For example, features include
mean word length, the use of nominalizations (nouns formed
from adjectives or verbs, such as development or robustness),
agentless passive voice, hedging phrases (such as something
like or almost), and clausal coordination. All features are
listed in the SI Appendix, Table S4. Differences between
LLM and human use of features were tested for statistical
significance with the paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test with
Bonferroni multiple comparison correction.
As a further check of generalizability, we used part of the
M4 parallel corpus (17) consisting of abstracts from the arXiv
preprint service alongside abstracts generated by GPT-3.5
when prompted with the preprint title. These texts are from a
different LLM (GPT-3.5) and a very distinct genre of writing
(academic abstracts), providing a check on the consistency of
results in different genres.
Results
Classifying text by source. A random forest classifier using
the Biber features to distinguish between the seven text
sources in HAP-E (human chunk 2 and the six LLMs)
achieved a test accuracy of 66%, compared to an expected
accuracy of 14% from random guessing. The confusion matrix,
shown in Figure 2, demonstrates that little of the error was
due to confusion between human texts and the LLMs: instead,
most classification errors confused Llama 3 8B and 70B,
Llama 3 8B Instruct and 70B Instruct, or GPT-4o and 4o
Mini. Each pair consists of models of two different sizes
trained on similar data, implying that the size difference does
not produce dramatically different style. Overall, only 4.2%
of LLM texts were falsely classified as human, and only 9.8%
of human texts were falsely classified as LLMs.

Fig. 2. Confusion matrix for a random forest classifying HAP-E texts by their linguistic
and rhetorical features, evaluated on the test set (25% of the HAP-E corpus, including
n = 14 , 535 human and LLM texts). The block diagonal structure indicates that
most classification errors were between different versions of the same LLM, rather
than between humans and LLMs.
Differences in style and vocabulary.Figure 3 illustrates the
large variation in rate of occurrence of the fifteen most
important features (as identified by the random forest) in
texts generated by LLMs, relative to the rate observed in the
human text. All four instruction-tuned models have strong
preferences for present participial clauses, ‘that’ clauses as
subjects, nominalization, and phrasal co-ordination, which are
typical markers of more informationally dense, noun-heavy
style of writing ( 27). For example, GPT-4o uses present
participial clauses at 5.3 times the rate of humans (paired
Cohen’s d = 1.38), ‘that’ clauses as subject 2.6 times as often
(d = 0.77), nominalizations 2.1 times as often ( d = 1.23), and
phrasal coordination 1.9 times as often (d = 0.81). (Rates and
effect sizes for all 66 features are provided in the SI Appendix,
Tables S5–S6; Figure S1 illustrates paired differences.) There
are also signs of local patterns that emerge with specific
models: both GPT-4o models avoid clausal coordination,
while all Llama 3 variants use it more frequently than humans;
while both GPT-4o models use downtoners (such as barely or
nearly) more frequently than humans, all Llama 3 variants
avoid them.
One might expect larger models to better match human
text than smaller models (e.g., Llama 70B versus Llama 8B,
or GPT-4o versus GPT-4o Mini), but this does not appear
to be the case in Figure 3. Also, instruction tuning appears
to make the model output less human, not more: the Llama
3 base models use features at rates similar to human texts,
while GPT-4o and Llama 3 instruction-tuned models have
much wider variation from feature to feature.
Similar to past research (14), we find that LLMs also favor
specific vocabulary. Figure 4 shows the rate of usage for
words used more than once per million words by humans,
comparing the usage of each LLM to the usage by humans
in Chunk 2 of HAP-E. Compared to the base Llama models,
in the instruction-tuned Llama and GPT-4o models certain
words are used at dramatically higher and lower rates. Table 1
highlights words overrepresented in LLM outputs: GPT-4o
and 4o Mini use words likecamaraderie, palpable, tapestry, and
intricate at more than 100 times the rate of humans, such as
in the GPT-4o output phrase “The camaraderie was palpable. ”
As a result, “tapestry” appeared in 23% of GPT-4o outputs
and “amidst” in 27% (SI Appendix, Table S7). Instruction-
tuned variants of Llama 3 also favor words like camaraderie
and palpable, as well as unease and reminder, though at
lower rates than GPT-4o and in a much smaller fraction of
documents.∗ Conversely, they use certain obscenities more
than 100 times less often (SI Appendix Table S8).
While many words listed in Table 1 may be occasionally
expected in belletristic works of fiction, their pervasiveness
across LLM output in a diverse array of genres is notable.
To those familiar with academic writing, newspapers, or
television scripts, these words are largely unexpected, and to
experts likely signal an overwritten, sentimental, or simply
uneven text. The point here is not that humans refrain
from using these words, but that humans refrain from using
these words in certain genres. In this case, words that
are unremarkable in fiction are highly conspicuous and
unconventional when used other genres. As word choice
appears most similar to humans for the base models, this
suggests the word choice bias is introduced by the instruction
tuning process, not simply by bias in the texts composing
the training sets.
In the GPT-4o models in particular, many of these words
connote some form of complex relation among objects (e.g.,
tapestry, intricate, camaraderie, cacophony, amidst). Coupled
with positive items such as vibrant and solace, these words
together may signal a preference for grandiose, if hollow,
summative sentences.
Distinguishing individual LLMs. When classifying between
human-generated text and one specific LLM, rather than
comparing all LLMs, our classifiers achieve much higher
accuracy. Typical accuracies achieved by random forests
were 93–98% even when trained on HAP-E and tested on
CAP or vice versa (SI Appendix Table S9). Lasso-penalized
logistic regression classifiers attained similar performance
for all LLMs except for the Llama base models, which had
accuracies around 75% (SI Appendix Table S10). Since the
lasso regressions only consider additive terms, this implies
that interactions between the Biber features contain relevant
signals for the Llama base models.
For both methods, the lower classification accuracy for the
Llama base models relative to the GPT-4o and instruction-
tuned Llama models indicates that instruction tuning may
lead to writing that is easier to distinguish from human
writing.
Generalization across corpora. When each pairwise random
forest was used to classify arXiv preprints from the M4 corpus,
accuracy dropped significantly. Random forests trained on
instruction-tuned LLMs were able to classify M4’s GPT-3.5
output with greater-than-chance accuracy, but models trained
on the Llama base outputs attained only 50% accuracy, equal
to random guessing (SI Appendix Tables S11–S12). These
results demonstrate that instruction-tuned LLMs do have
features in common that permit their classification, but that
generalizability across LLMs or to different registers of text
is difficult.
∗Some overuse may be artifacts of the generation process; for example, Llama 3 instruction-tuned
variants overuse continuation because their outputs sometimes begin with “Here is the continuation
of the text...” Llama base models have a tendency to repeat themselves, so Llama 3 8B uses
Deborah at 52 times the rate of humans largely because of a single document repeating it 308
times.

Discussion
This study identifies salient differences both between human
and LLM-generated texts and among various models. The
features that distinguish between humans and different LLMs
include present participial clauses, ‘that’ clauses as sentence
subject, passive voice, and nominalizations, to name a few.
These findings corroborate other research that points out
the ways these features produce informationally dense prose
(28). Other research links these features to increased lexical
diversity in generated text, as well as human judgments
of linguistic mastery ( 13). Lastly, prior work found that
ChatGPT-4 text evidences more nominalizations, and fewer
human subjects and epistemic stance markers ( 29), findings
we see reproduced in our list of distinguishing features.
A second major finding of this research is the apparently
central role of instruction tuning in creating these discrep-
ancies between human and model general texts. While we
do not have access to untuned versions of GPT, comparisons
between Llama’s base and tuned models emphasize the degree
to which instruction tuning pushes models to produce text
that reads unlike a human. This suggests that differences in
style are not simply due to the selection of texts for training
the base models, but due to the instruction-tuning process.
Similarly, differences between GPT-4o and the instruction-
tuned Llama variants may be due to differences in instruction
tuning, either through different human preferences in rating
responses or differences in the tasks (such as summarization)
used to tune the models. (As the instruction tuning processes
are not publicly documented, it is not possible to determine
the cause more precisely.) While instruction tuning has
previously been shown to introduce cognitive biases ( 30),
to our knowledge, these changes in writing style are not
discussed elsewhere in similar research.
A third major finding of this work is significant success
of Biber’s tagset in modeling and classifying text. This
success suggests that varied linguistic perspectives—which,
perhaps, are not prioritized during the development and
in-house assessments of LLMs—can reveal otherwise tacit
information that distinguishes a text as machine-generated.
With the linguistic perspective offered by pseudobibeR, we
built a model that recognizes machine-generated text with
relative ease. Our study reveals the clear value of linguistics
expertise and functional conceptions of language in both LLM
use and development.
That said, our intention is not to propose another way
to construct LLM detectors or to police the writing of
students and learners. Instead, we maintain that this type
of comparative analysis is useful for identifying differences
between human- and machine-generated text, zeroing in
on specific teachable moments in the revision of machine-
generated text.
As LLMs are increasingly put to work completing diverse
writing tasks, these results suggest a notable misalignment
between generated texts and the contexts in which we put
them to use. This is another way of saying that LLMs do
not vary their linguistic output in response to contextual
factors in ways similar to humans. This misalignment affects
experts and learners differently. For those proficient in a
genre—think, a therapist collating notes on a patient or, say,
a college graduate writing thank-you notes to friends and
family—this misalignment is likely flagged and the output is
appropriately revised. When the writer is proficient in the
genre, previous experience guides a current sense of what a
particular document should look like in order to be successful.
For experts, then, LLMs appear a worthwhile productivity
tool, suitable so long as they lend their expertise to further
shaping the output.
For learners, though, LLMs appear more problematic. Of
course, using LLMs to learn more about a concept, or help
generate ideas, is one thing. Using output in a text is a
different matter, one that may affect a student’s learning
trajectories. In this case, students offload the important
cognitive labor of shaping a text for a particular audience and
purpose to the LLM. Never mind that LLMs do not appear to
write like humans—when students offload writing work, they
offload opportunities to learn how to write IMRaD articles,
client reports, executive summaries, investment pitches, etc.
When LLMs are used in the classroom as writing tools,
instructors of all levels and disciplines need to help students
see both the shortcomings of the generated text and avenues
for improvement. LLMs are not bad, either technically or
morally—it is only that instructors must help inculcate in
students the critical perspective of the expert to know what’s
working and what isn’t.
In other contexts, however, overreliance on LLMs could
produce output that might be awkward and inauthentic (e.g.,
in a creative genre), confusing (e.g., in instructional material),
or unpersuasive (e.g., in argumentative texts). The current
work thus suggests the importance of LLM practice—both
in and out of the classroom—informed by human expertise
via a continual dialogue of creation and revision, where LLM
users are more aware and mindful of the effective uses as well
