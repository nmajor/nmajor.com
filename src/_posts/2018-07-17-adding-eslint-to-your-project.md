Linters can be annoying at first, but I feel like they really help me write better code. Plus they are great for working in teams to make sure everyone is following the same conventions.

We're going to walk through how to setup ESLint and add it to our project using a git pre-commit hook.

## Installation

First install the package eslint:

```bash
yarn add eslint --only=dev
```

Then initialize init and it will walk you through a typical setup:

```bash
yarn eslint --init
```

These are the options I selected. I like to start with the AirBnB template:

```bash
? How would you like to configure ESLint? Use a popular style guide
? Which style guide do you want to follow? Airbnb
? Do you use React? Yes
? What format do you want your config file to be in? JSON
```

The airbnb template is already set up to use react and it will install all sorts of nice dependencies for you.

And thats basically it!

## Configuration

It creates a file called `eslintrc.json` (the file will be different depending on which format you chose). And in this file will be your configuration.

If you open that file it will look like this:

```json
{
  "extends": "airbnb"
}
```

So it is basically just copying all of airbnb's rules. So if we want to now change the rules we are using we need to manually add them. We can turn off or change any rule and any rule we specify in our file will override the airbnb rule.

Here is an example of how to disable a rule called `no-underscore-dangle` and change the rule called `react/jsx-filename-extension` which requires all javascript files what use jsx to have the extension `.jsx`. This rule change also allows you to have `.js` extension.

```json
{
  "extends": "airbnb",
  "rules": {
    "react/jsx-filename-extension": [1, { "extensions": [".js", ".jsx"] }],
    "no-underscore-dangle": 0
  }
}
```

To disable eslint totally on a specific line, you can add this at the end of the line:

```js
var foo = "bar" // eslint-disable-line
```

And to disable 1 rule on that line you can add the rule like this:

```js
var foo = "bar" // eslint-disable-line no-alert
```

You can also do it this way:

```js
// eslint-disable-next-line
var foo = "bar"

// eslint-disable-next-line no-alert
var foo = "bar"
```

You can lint any file by running `yarn eslint path/to/file.js`.

You can also configure your editor to display any lint issues inline for you.

You can also set up a git pre-commit script to run before each commit which will enforce the lint rules in a very strong way.

## Setting up a ESLint pre-commit git hook

I'm assuming you already have a git repo setup.

Create a new file:

```bash
touch .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Make the file executable:

```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Then paste in this code here into that file:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

STAGED_FILES=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep ".jsx\{0,1\}$")
ESLINT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/node_modules/.bin/eslint"

if [[ "$STAGED_FILES" = "" ]]; then
  exit 0
fi

PASS=true

printf "\nValidating Javascript:\n"

# Check for eslint
if [[ ! -x "$ESLINT" ]]; then
  printf "\t\033[41mPlease install ESlint\033[0m (npm i --save-dev eslint)"
  exit 1
fi

for FILE in $STAGED_FILES
do
  "$ESLINT" "$FILE"

  if [[ "$?" == 0 ]]; then
    printf "\t\033[32mESLint Passed: $FILE\033[0m"
  else
    printf "\t\033[41mESLint Failed: $FILE\033[0m"
    PASS=false
  fi
done

printf "\nJavascript validation completed!\n"

if ! $PASS; then
  printf "\033[41mCOMMIT FAILED:\033[0m Your commit contains files that should pass ESLint but do not. Please fix the ESLint errors and try again.\n"
  exit 1
else
  printf "\033[42mCOMMIT SUCCEEDED\033[0m\n"
fi

exit $?
```

Now anytime someone commits, any javascript files included in the commit will have to pass the lint test!
